## TASK 2: Hunger for Data
What questions would you ask the company, employees to understand the data better? What additional data would you require to draw better inferences out of the data?

Question 1: Are there any external factors that could impact the data? For example, industry trends, market conditions, or changes in the organization's strategy that could influence the performance, happiness, or growth of the Student Unicorn.

Question 2: Are there any benchmarks or targets set for each parameter? It would be helpful to know if there are specific goals or thresholds that the company aims to achieve in terms of performance, happiness, and growth.

Question 3: Can you provide any context or background information related to the data? Understanding the specific initiatives, projects, or challenges that might have influenced the data can provide valuable insights.

Question 4: Can you share any qualitative feedback or observations from employees regarding the parameters being measured? This can help provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the data and potential areas for improvement.

Question 5: What specific metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) are being tracked in each parameter? Can you provide more details about how these metrics are measured and calculated?
